# frydomics
A journal club for -omicsy things @ UCLA. Send me a paper if you'd like to suggest one, otherwise I will choose.

We meet in the sixth floor conference room of [Gonda](https://www.gonda.ucla.edu/) Thursdays at 5:30 for beer and science. If you're reading this, feel free to stop by.

We are modeled after Jeff Ross-Ibarra's [REHAB](http://www.rilab.org/rehab.html), please check there for information on the format. In short, no one presents the paper and we jump in as soon as the beer arrives.

We have a mailing list [here](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/frydomics). Feel free to join or email me (firstname.lastname@gmail.com) for paper annoucements.

Here's some data on who's suggesting papers:
