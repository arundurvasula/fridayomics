# frydomics
A journal club for -omicsy things @ UCLA. Send me a paper if you'd like to suggest one, otherwise I will choose. 

We meet at [Wolfgang Puck's](https://wolfgangpuck.com/dining/wolfgang-puck-express-los-angeles/) Fridays at 5 for beer and science. Feel free to stop by.

We are modeled after Jeff Ross-Ibarra's [REHAB](http://www.rilab.org/rehab.html).

# Papers:
